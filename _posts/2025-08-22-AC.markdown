# LM vs LLM
You can hammer in a nail with a crescent wrench and do linear regression with ChatGPT.  We have a strong sense of the "appropriate" tool for the job in many domains, but that sense is currently underdeveloped in the world of AI.

# What is Appropriate Computing?
The "appropriate technology" (AT) movement emerged in response to rampant industrialization in the 1960s.  It's central idea is that technology should be developed and deployed in consideration of a broad context of society and ecology.  Human flourishing, rather than profit, becomes the focus.  This framework can be adapted to our current technological transition, as computational techniques, from simple rule-based approaches to trillion parameter LLMs, become important fixtures of our daily existence.  


# Small is Beautiful vs Bigger is Better
"Small is Beautiful" was both the title of book with which Fritz Schumacher initiated AT and a central credo of the movement's philosophy.  The judgement is on an aesthetic levelIn general, "smaller" technologies generally have more predictable failure modes and a tendency to augment rather than replace human agency.  This insight becomes increasingly relevant as we witness a massive buildout of power hungry data centers, each optimized to run a proliferation of thinly disguised LLM wrappers, many aiming to displace millions from their jobs and sense of worth.  Simultaneously, frontier labs are pursuing exponentially scaling both training and inference costs in the (increasingly dubious) hope that this approach will lead to superhuman intelligence.  

# Strength in Fit
Appropriate computing offers a third path between the utopian dreams of accelerationists and the dystopian nightmares of the doomers.  Existing computational tools, from linear regression to LLMs, are an incredible toolbox.  Within them exists enormous utility to promote human welfare, dignity, and agency, but this promise is best realized through consideration of their roles as participants in broader complex systems.  The goal of this blog is to share thoughts that may be useful in this attempt.  Planned posts range from philosophical and mathematical thoughts on LLM properties and complex system theory to concrete applications in medicine, education, ecological stewarship, and agriculture.

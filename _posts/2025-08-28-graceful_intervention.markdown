#Industrial vs Regenerative Agriculture
Contrast a modern midwestern corn megafarm with a small family farm of 1850.  In both situations, farmers are working to optimize the yield on their plot of land, which can be thought of as driving a complex system toward a desired output of high productivity.  

The constraints on the first are related to labor, cognition, and attention.  The scale is vast, requiring intensive automation and standardization.  Interventions are coarse but powerful-- fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides.  Downstream effects are debatable, but, given enough summer rain, the quantitative outcome is reliably high.

The family farmer enjoys an intimate familiarity with his plot of land, but his toolbox is much more limited.  Having no chemical pesticides or fertilizers, he relies on the a set of traditional methods, each relatively limited in power but selected for their potential to shift a plot from decay to productivity. Successful stewardship here requires a long time horizon, careful monitoring, thoughtful planning, and lots of labor input (weeding, etc).  One of the most successful strategies relies on cultivating a system where cognition works to his benefit.  Plants selected for robustness to disease (immune system cognition working to his benefit), plantings that encourage predators, amendments that encourage beneficial microbes.

#Collaborative Intelligence
Where would humans be without the cognition of the bee or the dog, let alone the ecological intelligence of the farm field?  Throughout our history, humans have learned to intervene in complex systems by harnessing the the thoughts and actions of collaborators.  As with any history, its stories are a mix of tragedy and triumph, often mixed together in a single episode.  As we begin to grapple with the introduction of a collaborator of unprecedented flexibility (the AI variety), we should draw whatever lessons we can from this history.

##Cognitive Bottlenecks
In examining these histories, I've found one unifying concept to be particularly useful.  I call it the "cognitive bottleneck."  The idea is that you have a recurrent situation where there's enough information to act in a helpful way, but not enough human bandwidth to make these decisions.  One nice thing about cognitive bottlenecks is that you often don't need human (let alone superhuman) intelligence to shift the system into a better state.

A couple examples from our history stand out.  Domestication of plants and animals.  Regenerative agriculture as a

## What are we talking about?
Over the past year or so, a group at [Cal Poly Humboldt](https://www.humboldt.edu/) has been meeting to understand how to promote a sustainable future for AI use and development. We've been calling our team the "[Appropriate Computing Discussion Group](https://sites.google.com/humboldt.edu/acdg?usp=sharing)", in a nod to the [locally significant](https://www.humboldt.edu/ccat) [Appropriate Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology) movement of the 1960s.  This blog is meant as a place to record the ideas that emerge from these discussions.

## Inappropriate Computing
As algorithms and automation begin to dominate our everyday experiences, we're surrounded by examples of inappropriate applications.  Biased, unaccountable decision-making [tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Post_Office_scandal), interfaces that reduce costs (by eliminating jobs) but increase user frustration, and poorly understood AI models that often fail in [spectacularly dangerous ways](https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/), among others.  These are the teething pains of a new technological paradigm.  What can we learn from similar periods in history?

## What is Appropriate Computing?
The "appropriate technology" (AT) movement emerged in response to rampant industrialization in the 1960s.  The thesis is that technology should be developed and deployed in consideration of a broad context of society and ecology.  Sustainable human flourishing, rather than profit, is the focus.  This framework can be adapted to our current technological transition, as computational techniques, from simple rule-based approaches to trillion parameter large language models (LLMs), become important fixtures of our daily existence.

Appropriate computing offers a third path between the utopian dreams of [effective accelerationists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism) and the dystopian nightmares of [AI doomers](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-disagreements).  Just as regenerative agriculture provided a pragmatic, positive response to the excesses of industrialized food production (a theme I will develop in a later post), appropriate computing aims to solve real problems with algorithms, but with an emphasis on systems thinking, robustness, and context.


## Small is Beautiful vs Bigger is Better
An important philosophy in AT (and the title of the [book](https://archive.org/details/SmallIsBeautiful-E.F.Shumacher) that kicked off the movement) is that "small is beautiful". In general, "smaller" technologies have more predictable failure modes and augment, rather than replace, human agency.  This insight stands in opposition to the philosophy of our current AI boom, which can be summed up as "bigger is better" (or more precisely, the "[bitter lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)" and the "[scaling hypothesis](https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis)").  

As a society, we're currently investing staggering amounts of capital (data centers, electrical power, human creativity, etc) to build extremely complex, poorly understood technologies.  The great hope is that these massively costly technologies will succeed in putting us all out of a job!

## Strength in Fit
It's a tough scene, but there is hope.  Current computational tools, from linear regression to LLMs, comprise a versatile toolbox.  These algorithms have enormous capacity to promote welfare, dignity, and agency, but their utility comes not from their size or raw strength, but their fit for purpose.    

Finding an appropriate fit requires deep understandings of both the computational tools available and the systems with which they interact.  The blog is a place share thoughts on this theme.  Planned posts range from philosophical and mathematical thoughts on model properties and systems dynamics to concrete applications of computational tools in medicine, education, ecological stewardship, and agriculture.
